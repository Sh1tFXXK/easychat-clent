# EasyChat-client

## Introduction

Easychat-client is the front-end part of EasyChat project, which is developed based on Vue cli.

EasyChat is an instant messaging platform that can chat online. It is completely designed and developed by individuals. The original intention is to have fun and learn some new things by the way, so the website is a little crude. It is true that my ability and financial resources are limited. There is no paid content on the website, and all content is completely free. Welcome to use the experience, and look forward to your communication and feedback.
